    "### Data Source:\r\n",
    "The data used in this analysis comes from a cleaned Zomato restaurant dataset. Key columns:\r\n",
    "- **Cost**: The cost of dining at the restaurant.\r\n",
    "- **Rating**: The rating given to the restaurant.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Methodology:\r\n",
    "1. **Data Preprocessing**:  \r\n",
    "   - The dataset was cleaned to remove any missing or invalid values.\r\n",
    "   - We split restaurants into two groups based on the median cost:\r\n",
    "     - **High-Cost Restaurants**: Restaurants with a cost higher than the median.\r\n",
    "     - **Low-Cost Restaurants**: Restaurants with a cost less than or equal to the median.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "2. **Statistical Test**:  \r\n",
    "   A **two-sample t-test** was performed to check if thereâ€™s a significant difference between the ratings of high-cost and low-cost restaurants. We used `equal_var=False` to account for unequal variances between the groups.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Results:\r\n",
    "- **T-Statistic**: 47.6845\r\n",
    "- **P-Value**: 0.0000\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Since the p-value is much smaller than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis, which means there is a significant difference in ratings between high-cost and low-cost restaurants.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Conclusion:\r\n",
    "There **is a significant relationship** between dining cost and restaurant rating. High-cost restaurants tend to have higher ratings compared to low-cost restaurants.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Implications:\r\n",
    "- **For restaurant owners**: Increasing dining cost may lead to higher ratings, though other factors (like service and food quality) matter too.\r\n",
    "- **For consumers**: Higher-cost restaurants may have higher ratings, but it's important to consider other factors when choosing a restaurant.\r\n",
    "- **For marketers**: Emphasize the value of dining experiences in higher-cost restaurants to attract customers."

    "To determine if there is a significant correlation between the **cost of a restaurant** and the **number of votevotesunt)** it receives.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### 2. **Methodology**\r\n",
    "- A **Pearson correlation test** was performed to examine the relationship between:\r\n",
    "  - The **cost** of the restaurant (`cost`)\r\n",
    "  - The **number of vovotesng_count`)\r\n",
    "- The correlation coefficient and p-value were computed to assess the strength and statistical significance of the relationship.\r\n",

    "\r\n",
    "### 4. **Interpretation**\r\n",
    "- The **positive correlation** of 0.3799 indicates that as the **cost** of a restaurant increases, the **number of votes** it receives tends to increase as well, though the relationship is **moderate**.\r\n",
    "- This suggests that **expensive restaurants** are likely to receive **more votes**, but the relationship is not very strong.\r\n",

    "### 5. **Conclusion**\r\n",
    "- There is a **statistically significant moderate positive correlation** between restaurant cost and the number of votes.\r\n",
    "- **Higher-cost restaurants** tend to receive **more votes**, but the correlation is not strong enough to say that cost alone influences the number of votes.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### 6. **Recommendations**\r\n",
    "- **Expensive restaurants** may benefit from receiving more votes due to their higher cost, but **other factors** (such as quality, service, and reputation) likely also play a role in generating customer engagement.\r\n",
    "- Future analyses could explore how **restaurant quality**, **service reviews**, and **location** influence engagement (votes) and better understand what drives higher ratings."
